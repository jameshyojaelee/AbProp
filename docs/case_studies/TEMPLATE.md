# Case Study: <Title>

## Background
- **Objective**: What decision or hypothesis is being tested?
- **Dataset**: Link to splits / parquet snapshots.
- **Artifacts**: Figures, notebooks, dashboards.

## Methodology
1. Steps taken (data filters, commands, scripts).
2. Key parameters (checkpoints, thresholds, uncertainty settings).
3. Tools (scripts, notebooks, dashboards) used for analysis.

## Results
- Core findings with quantitative metrics (perplexity, F1, RMSE, etc.).
- Uncertainty summaries (MC-dropout variance, ensemble spread).
- Visual references (attention heatmaps, embeddings).

## Interpretation
- How the findings influence engineering decisions.
- Risks, edge cases, or anomalies observed.

## Next Steps
- Follow-up experiments, validations, or product integrations.
- Links to Jira/Asana issues or future prompts.
