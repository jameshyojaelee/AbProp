# Attention Figure Staging

Run `scripts/visualize_attention.py` to populate this directory with curated examples. Suggested convention:

```
outputs/
└── attention/
    ├── success/
    │   ├── aggregated/
    │   └── heads/
    └── failure/
        ├── aggregated/
        └── heads/
```

Copy notable PNG/HTML outputs here when preparing slide decks or reports. Pair each drop with a short note outlining why the example is interesting (e.g., “CDR3 attention concentrates on liability hot spot despite high developability score”).

Refer to `docs/TRAINING_GUIDE.md` for CLI usage details.
